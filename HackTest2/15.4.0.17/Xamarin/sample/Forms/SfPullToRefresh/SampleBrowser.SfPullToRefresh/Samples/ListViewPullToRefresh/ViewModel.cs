The latest company to fully invest in the trend towards AI-powered technology is Intel. In late March, they announced the formation of the Intel Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG), an organization that intends to consolidate the company’s AI efforts across all its divisions.\n\nThis move towards unifying AI projects isn’t simply a pivot towards the future; Intel has invested heavily in AI development. Over the past two years, Intel has acquired an AI-processor startup, a computer-vision developer, a driverless car developer, and an FPGA manufacturer. Each of these acquisitions either gives Intel an entry point to specific AI development targets or provides a technology to support AI development.",

These libraries are used across a spectrum of business scenarios, but are most often used to create richly formatted reports. Combining these libraries with cross-platform mobile development enabled by Xamarin.Forms can greatly simplify your document needs within your mobile apps, whether it involves file conversion, filling templates, importing data, or generating documents from scratch.",

           "In college, I did everything in UNIX. On UNIX, everything was centered around programming. Of course, you probably had to be a programmer to get anything done or at least appreciate it.  The big debate of the day was the merits of vi vs emacs. After much deliberation, I settled on emacs. Despite its power, vi was just a bit too cryptic for me. Emacs was very powerful, still quite cryptic, but had nearly endless options for customization.\n\nYou could start up emacs and stay there all day. It didn’t matter whether you wanted to run a command shell, query a database, read email, or even browse the web, there was no reason to leave emacs. Regardless of the type of file you were editing, there was a custom mode available to help with editing that file. Whether it was the password file, Fortran, lisp, C, C++, HTML, SQL, Eiffel, or something else, there was a language-specific editor mode ready to help with syntax highlighting, indention support, matching parenthesis, and more",

Now, with the integration of Xamarin and Visual Studio, .NET developers can use C# to build native apps for Android and iOS.\n\nSyncfusion adds a lot of power to the Microsoft-Xamarin mix by offering Essential Studio for Xamarin. Tomorrow’s webinar, Visual Studio 2017 + Xamarin + Syncfusion, presented by Aaron Melamed at 11:00 a.m. EDT, will demonstrate how you can use Syncfusion’s suite of Xamarin controls to quickly build native apps that run on Windows, Android, and iOS.",

Intended as the next step in Microsoft’s ongoing efforts to develop more capable AI, Zo has been rolled out on more platforms and been made available to more users.\n\nChatbots are social AIs designed to interact with human users via text chatting or direct, spoken communication. There are a variety of uses for chatbots, from allowing for a more natural user interface to simply being a form of entertainment. The chief concern is that software programmed to communicate with a human must acquire language and deploy it correctly, a challenge of titanic proportions. ",
           "As you’ve probably noticed, Visual Studio 2017 was released on Tuesday. Excitement has been mounting since the release candidate came out in November, and the final version is finally here. We at Syncfusion have been jumping up and down—usually figuratively, but sometimes literally—with anticipation because we’ve been wanting to share that we’re SIM-SHIPPING Essential Studio 2017 Volume 1 with Visual Studio 2017!\n\nOh yes, that’s 800+ Essential Studio components and frameworks fully compatible with VS2017, all for your seamless developing convenience. You are very welcome.\n\nWe were so excited about sim-shipping we had to throw an early party for Visual Studio 2017 and keep it secret until now. After all, it’s not every year you turn 20 and become a brand new version of yourself. We strongly felt this deserved cake.",
           "With the Visual Studio 2017 launch underway, developers around the globe are focusing on how the new features in Microsoft’s updated IDE will improve their dev-ops. Because of Visual Studio’s impetus to constantly move development forward, much of the conversation surrounding these launches has to do with what’s coming, not what has been.\n\nBut with this release, Visual Studio celebrates its twentieth birthday. To reflect on this notable milestone, Syncfusion asked a variety of developers when they started working with Visual Studio and what features meaningfully changed how they develop.\n\nThe majority of people we surveyed said they started working with Visual Studio 6.0, which was released in 1998. The previous year, Microsoft released Visual Studio 97, described in this Microsoft Systems Journal article:",

We are glad to have both leading sessions again. Our new colleague Aaron Melamed, product solution specialist at Syncfusion, will also participate at the event. We’re sure that Aaron will provide insight for attendees since, as he said, “I have dipped my toes into the Xamarin world after writing a cross-platform app that searches thousands of curated recipes via an API.”",

Here’s the webinar if you missed it.\n\nAs promised, here is a summary of the Q&A portion from the end of the webinar, plus answers to questions we couldn’t get to then:\n\nDoes the chart work inside a ScrollView?\nYes.\n\nWhat about MVVM support? I use Prism and a kind of pure MVVM model. Is it easy to integrate the charts in that model?\nYes. There’s complete MVVM support. Prism and other packages should all work well.",
           "(This guest blog was written by Wolfgang Loder, February 2017.)\n\nWhenever web developers are asked about a language or framework they want to try, most likely the language Elm will be mentioned.\n\nThis is not an Elm primer, so I assume you have a little experience with the Elm basics. If not, the following paragraphs will give you an idea what can be achieved with the Elm platform.\n\nAs much as Elm libraries try to cover everything needed for web applications development, there are gaps and inadequate solutions. This is why pure Elm applications may be good for demos and simple applications, but are not always feasible for production code. We will often have to enhance Elm code with JavaScript libraries.",
